# Planning Document.

Use this document to start outlining how you will write your program. What kind of variables, conditionals, and Boolean statements will you need?

### Goal

* ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59f7f32e-6160-4caa-9d3d-1f50962e6e2d)


## Variables Used...

* First off, I will uses lists to store the shapes, and they will append to another list to keep track of them.
* I will also use numbers to count the number of shapes being appended, along with allowing the code to iterate through each shape.
* Additionally, there will be conditional statements such as "while" to stop the code when it reaches it iterations.
* This also consists of a true boolean statement. For example, the while statement could be "while x > 2: ___". This indicates that once x is greater than 2, it will become a false statment, thus stopping the code.

## Step by Step Outline

* Start off by changing the places where the shapes are and create an octagon. While drawing the octagon, draw a shape on each angle.

* Then, change the color of each shape to be unique from the other shapes.

* Test code and fix any errors
